### Solution
- **_solution1.py_** :point_right: sort the arrays, then use merge logic of merge-sort **time-complexity O(Nlog(N) + Mlog(M) + N + M)**, **space-complexity O(1)**.
- **_solution2.py_** :point_right: sort the arrays, then use merge logic of merge-sort **time-complexity O(Nlog(N) + Mlog(M) + N + M)**, **space-complexity O(1)**.
