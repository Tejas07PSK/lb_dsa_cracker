### Problem Links
- **__GeeksForGeeks__** :point_right: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-level-order-traversal/1

### Solution
- **_solution.py_** :point_right: use standard queue based traversal technique, but always consider the right sub-tree first for each node, in the end reverse the result list **time-complexity O(N)**, **space-complexity O(N)**.
