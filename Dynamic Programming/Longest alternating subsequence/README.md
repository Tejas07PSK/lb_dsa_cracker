- **__GeeksForGeeks__** :point_right: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-alternating-subsequence5951/1

### Solution
- **_solution1.py_** :point_right: use bottom-up dp with tabulation, refer to linear-space longest increasing subsequence approach **time-complexity O(N^2)**, **space-complexity O(N)**
- **_solution2.py_** :point_right: use bottom-up dp with tabulation, time-optimized **time-complexity O(N)**, **space-complexity O(N)**
- **_solution3.py_** :point_right: use approach from solution2.py and observe that space can be optimized more through 2 variables **time-complexity O(N)**, **space-complexity O(1)**
