---

### Problem Links
- **__LeetCode__** :point_right: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-pair-chain/description/

### Solution
- **_solution1.py_** :point_right: use top-down dp, with memoization **time-complexity O(Nlog(N))**, **space-complexity O(N)**
- **_solution2.py_** :point_right: use bottom-up dp, with tabulation **time-complexity O(Nlog(N))**, **space-complexity O(N)**
- **_solution3.py_** :point_right: use greedy strategy, very similar to activity-selection problem and meeting-rooms problem **time-complexity O(Nlog(N))**, **space-complexity O(1)**
