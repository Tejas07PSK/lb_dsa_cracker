### Problem Links
- **__CodeStudio__** :point_right: https://www.codingninjas.com/codestudio/problems/permutationcoefficient_1214975

### Solution
- **_solution1.py_** :point_right: use top-down dp with memoization, look at code **time-complexity O(n * arr_sum_half)**, **space-complexity O(n * arr_sum_half)**
- **_solution2.py_** :point_right: use bottom-up dp with tabulation, look at code **time-complexity O(n * arr_sum_half)**, **space-complexity O(arr_sum_half)**
- **_solution3.py_** :point_right: use sets of sub-set sums method, look at code **time-complexity O(n * arr_sum_half)**, **space-complexity O(n * arr_sum_half)**
