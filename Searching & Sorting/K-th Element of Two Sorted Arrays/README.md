### Problem Links
- **__GeeksForGeeks__** :point_right: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/k-th-element-of-two-sorted-array1317/1

### Solution
- **_solution.py_** :point_right: use careful binary-search over first array, very similar to find median of 2 sorted arrays technique **time-complexity O(log(minSize(A,B)))**, **space-complexity O(1)**.
