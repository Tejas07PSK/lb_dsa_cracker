### Problem Links
- **__GeeksForGeeks__** :point_right: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/the-painters-partition-problem1535/1/

### Solution
- **_solution.py_** :point_right: use binary search over range [1, sum(board_lenghts_array)], rest of the steps are very similar to the book-allocation problem **time-complexity O(Nlog(sum(board_lenghts_array)))**, **space-complexity O(1)**.
