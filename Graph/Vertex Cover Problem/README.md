### Solution
- **_solution1.py_** :point_right: use gosper's subset generation method with binary search, refer to this post (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/finding-minimum-vertex-cover-graph-using-binary-search/) **time-complexity O(Elog(V))**, **space-complexity O(E+V)**.
- **_solution2.py_** :point_right: use greedy approximate method **time-complexity O(E(V+E))**, **space-complexity O(V+E)**.
