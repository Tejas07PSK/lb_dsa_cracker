### Problem Links
- **__GeeksForGeeks__** :point_right: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sort-a-linked-list/1

### Solution
- **_solution.py_** :point_right: use standard merge-sort with two mods due to linked list, first use slow/fast pointers technique to find mid node at every recursive step, second merge the sorted halves in-place **time-complexity O(Nlog(N))**, **space-complexity O(1)**.
