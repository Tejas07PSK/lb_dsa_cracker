### Solution
- **_solution.py_** :point_right: use straight-forward trie implementaion, with proper search and insert methods **time-complexity O(M+|search|)**, **space-complexity O(M)**, where M denotes sum of the lengths of all the strings present in input list and |search| denotes the length of the string search.
