# Implement a Circular queue

---

### Problem Links
- **__LeetCode__** :point_right: https://leetcode.com/problems/design-circular-queue/

### Solution
- **_solution1.py_** :point_right: use standard ad-hoc logic with a circular linked-list, look at code **time-complexity O(N) for initialization and O(1) for enQueue, deQueue, Front, Rear, isFull, isEmpty**, **space-complexity O(N) for the underlying linked-list and O(1) for enQueue, deQueue, Front, Rear, isFull, isEmpty**.
- **_solution2.py_** :point_right: use standard ad-hoc logic with an array, look at code **time-complexity O(N) for initialization and O(1) for enQueue, deQueue, Front, Rear, isFull, isEmpty**, **space-complexity O(N) for the underlying array and O(1) for enQueue, deQueue, Front, Rear, isFull, isEmpty**.
